# Day 3 

## Problem Statement
  - Pull a docker image manually by `docker pull <image_name>:tag` can be a tedious task when you are working in some mission critical task.
  - We can make this image pulling task easier with python script.

## Autopull a  list of Docker image
   - Install docker package
   - Define a function named **pull_docker_image()**
   - Create a list of image you want to pull
   - Use a for loop to perform the pull of images from registry
